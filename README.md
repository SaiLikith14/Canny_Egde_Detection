# Canny_Egde_Detection

**Theory**
Canny edge Detection is a popular edge detection algorithm. It was developed by John F.Canny.

These are the stages involved to generate edges from given inout image:
1. Grayscale Conversion
2. Noise Reduction (Gaussian Filter)
3. Determining Intensity Gradients (Vertical and Horizontal Kernels(Sobel Filter))
4. Non_Max Suppression
5. Edge Tracing by Double Thresholding Hysteresis
